  //  - The title.  %h and %v expand to the hostname and Anyterm version.
  //  - The number of rows and columns.
  //  - An optional parameter which is substituted for %p in the command string. (workingdirectory)
  //  - An optional character set.
  //  - An option number of lines of scrollback (default 0). THIS ONE IS A BIT BUGGY

  // closing.  You could send them back to your home page, or something.
