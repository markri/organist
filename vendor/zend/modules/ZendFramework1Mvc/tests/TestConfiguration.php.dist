/**
 * Zend_Loader_Autoloader multi-version support tests

 * PATH:         path to a directory containing multiple ZF version installs
 * LATEST:       most recent ZF version in the PATH
 *               e.g., "1.9.2"
 * LATEST_MAJOR: most recent ZF major version in the PATH to test against
 *               e.g., "1.9.2"

 * SPECIFIC:     specific ZF version in the PATH to test against
 *               e.g., "1.7.6"
 * As an example, consider the following tree:
 *     ZendFramework/
 *     |-- 1.9.2
 *     |-- ZendFramework-1.9.1-minimal
 *     |-- 1.8.4PL1

 *     |-- ZendFramework-1.8.3
 *     |-- 1.7.8
 *     |-- 1.7.7
 *     |-- 1.7.6
 * You would then set the value of "LATEST" and "LATEST_MAJOR" to "1.9.2", and
 * could choose between "1.9.2", "1.8.4PL1", and "1.7.8" for "LATEST_MINOR",
 * and any version number for "SPECIFIC". "PATH" would point to the parent
 * "ZendFramework" directory.
