    <para>
        This QuickStart is intended to get developers familiar with the concepts
        of the Zend\Di DiC.  Generally speaking, code is never as simple as it is
        inside this example, so working knowledge of the other sections of the
        manual is suggested.
    </para>

    <para>
        Assume for a moment, you have the following code as part of your application
        that you feel is a good candidate for being managed by a DiC, after all,
        you are already injecting all your dependencies:
    </para>


    <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
namespace MyLibrary
{
    class DbAdapter
    {
        protected $username = null;
        protected $password = null;
        public function __construct($username, $password)
        {
            $this->username = $username;
            $this->password = $password;
        }
    }
}

namespace MyMovieApp
{
    class MovieFinder
    {
        protected $dbAdapter = null;
        public function __construct(\MyLibrary\DbAdapter $dbAdapter)
        {
            $this->dbAdapter = $dbAdapter;
        }
    }

    class MovieLister
    {
        protected $movieFinder = null;
        public function __construct(MovieFinder $movieFinder)
        {
            $this->movieFinder = $movieFinder;
        }
    }
}
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        With the above code, you find yourself writing the following to
        wire and utilize this code:
    </para>


    <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
// $config object is assumed

$dbAdapter = new MyLibrary\DbAdapter($config->username, $config->password);
$movieFinder = new MyMovieApp\MovieFinder($dbAdapter);
$movieLister = new MyMovieApp\MovieLister($movieFinder);
foreach ($movieLister as $movie) {
    // iterate and display $movie
}
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        If you are doing this above wiring in each controller or view that
        wants to list movies, not only can this become repetitive and
        boring to write, but also unmaintainable if for example you want to
        swap out one of these dependencies on a wholesale scale.
    </para>

    <para>
        Since this example of code already practices good dependency injection,
        with constructor injection, it is a great candidate for using Zend\Di.
        The usage is as simple as:
    </para>


    <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
    // inside a bootstrap somewhere
    $di = new Zend\Di\Di();
    $di->instanceManager()->setParameters('MyLibrary\DbAdapter', array(
        'username' => $config->username,
        'password' => $config->password
    ));

    // inside each controller
    $movieLister = $di->get('MyMovieApp\MovieLister');
    foreach ($movieLister as $movie) {
        // iterate and display $movie
    }
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        In the above example, we are obtaining a default instance of
        Zend\Di\Di.  By 'default', we mean that Zend\Di\Di is constructed with
        a DefinitionList seeded with a RuntimeDefinition (uses Reflection) and an
        empty instance manager and no configuration.
        Here is the Zend\Di\Di constructor:
    </para>


    <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
    public function __construct(DefinitionList $definitions = null, InstanceManager $instanceManager = null, Configuration $config = null)
    {
        $this->definitions = ($definitions) ?: new DefinitionList(new Definition\RuntimeDefinition());
        $this->instanceManager = ($instanceManager) ?: new InstanceManager();

        if ($config) {
            $this->configure($config);
        }
    }
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        This means that when $di->get() is called, it will be consulting the
        RuntimeDefinition, which uses reflection to understand the structure of the code.
        Once it knows the structure of the code, it can then know how the dependencies
        fit together and how to go about wiring your objects for you.
        Zend\Di\Definition\RuntimeDefinition will utilize the names of the parameters in the
        methods as the class parameter names.  This is how both username and password key
        are mapped to the first and second parameter, respectively, of the constructor
        consuming these named parameters.
    </para>

    <para>
        If you were to want to pass in the username and password at call time, this is
        achieved by passing them as the second argument of get():
    </para>


    <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
    // inside each controller
    $di = new Zend\Di\Di();
    $movieLister = $di->get('MyMovieApp\MovieLister', array(
        'username' => $config->username,
        'password' => $config->password
    ));
    foreach ($movieLister as $movie) {
        // iterate and display $movie
    }
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        It is important to note that when using call time parameters, these parameter
        names will be applied to any class that accepts a parameter of such name.
    </para>

    <para>
        By calling $di->get(), this instance of MovieLister will be automatically shared.
        This means subsequent calls to get() will return the same instance as previous
        calls.  If you wish to have completely new instances of MovieLister, you can
        utilize $di->newInstance().

    </para>
