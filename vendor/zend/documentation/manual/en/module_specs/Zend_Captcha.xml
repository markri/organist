        stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans
        Apart"; it is used as a challenge-response to ensure that the individual
        submitting information is a human and not an automated process. Typically, a
        captcha is used with form submissions where authenticated users are not
        necessary, but you want to prevent spam submissions.
