    <para>
        Often multiple filters should be applied to some value in a particular order. For example, a
        login form accepts a username that should be only lowercase, alphabetic characters.
        <classname>Zend_Filter</classname> provides a simple method by which filters may be chained
        together. The following code illustrates how to chain together two filters for the submitted
        username:
    </para>

    <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
// Create a filter chain and add filters to the chain
$filterChain = new Zend_Filter();
$filterChain->addFilter(new Zend_Filter_Alpha())
            ->addFilter(new Zend_Filter_StringToLower());

// Filter the username
$username = $filterChain->filter($_POST['username']);
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        Filters are run in the order they were added to <classname>Zend_Filter</classname>. In the
        above example, the username is first removed of any non-alphabetic characters, and then any
        uppercase characters are converted to lowercase.
    </para>

    <para>
        Any object that implements <classname>Zend_Filter_Interface</classname> may be used in a
        filter chain.
    </para>

        <para>
            Since 1.10, the <classname>Zend_Filter</classname> chain also
            supports altering the chain by prepending or appending filters. For
            example, the next piece of code does exactly the same as the other
            username filter chain example:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
// Create a filter chain and add filters to the chain
$filterChain = new Zend_Filter();

// this filter will be appended to the filter chain
$filterChain->appendFilter(new Zend_Filter_StringToLower());

// this filter will be prepended at the beginning of the filter chain.
$filterChain->prependFilter(new Zend_Filter_Alpha());

// Filter the username
$username = $filterChain->filter($_POST['username']);
]]></programlisting>
