        View placeholders are a simple and powerful method for creating rich layouts for your
        application. You can use a variety of standard placeholders, such as those discussed
        (<methodname>doctype()</methodname>, <methodname>headTitle()</methodname>,
        <methodname>headLink()</methodname>, and <methodname>headScript()</methodname>), or use
        the generic <methodname>placeholder()</methodname> helper to aggregate content and render it
        in custom ways. Experiment with their exposed functionality, and visit the appropriate
        sections in the reference guide to find out about the additional features they offer -- and
        how you may leverage those features to create rich content for your readers.
