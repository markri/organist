        You have now built a very simple application using some of the most commonly used Zend
        Framework components. Zend Framework makes many components available to you which address
        most common requirements in web applications, including web services, search,
        <acronym>PDF</acronym> reading and writing, authentication, authorization, and much more.
        The <link linkend="reference">Reference Guide</link> is a great place to find out more about
        the components you've used in this QuickStart as well as other components. We hope you find
        Zend Framework useful and - more importantly - fun!
