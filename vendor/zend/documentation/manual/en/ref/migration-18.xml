        When upgrading from a previous release to Zend Framework 1.8 or higher you
        should note the following migration notes.

            <para>
                As translated segments were introduced into the new standard
                route, the '<emphasis>@</emphasis>' character is now a special character
                in the beginning of a route segment. To be able to use it in a
                static segment, you must escape it by prefixing it with second
                '<emphasis>@</emphasis>' character. The same rule now applies for the
                '<emphasis>:</emphasis>' character.

            <para>
                As with Zend Framework 1.8 a default caching was added. The reason behind this
                change was, that most users had performance problems but did not add caching at
                all. As the I18n core is a bottleneck when no caching is used we decided to add
                a default caching when no cache has been set to <classname>Zend_Locale</classname>.
            </para>

            <para>
                Sometimes it is still wanted to prevent caching at all even if this decreases
                performance. To do so you can simply disable caching by using the
                <methodname>disableCache()</methodname> method.
